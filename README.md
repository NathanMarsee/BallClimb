Astroll, 
astro roll, 
a stroll...

Orbit is the goal, the expanse of space waits below. . . . roll

A Single=Player 3D physics-based platformer game that allows you to experience the pull of gravity in space. Climb, jump, roll, bounce across platforms, bridges, and cages in space. Up is relative and to escape the desolation of space, you must use your joystick to precisely maneuver through a maze of challenging obstacles. Remember, space is vast but falling is sometimes just part of the game and your stroll isn't over till you really reach the stars.
